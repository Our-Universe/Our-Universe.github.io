                             Project: Our Universe
							 </h1>
                             <p>							 
							 This is our universe, your creations contribute to an endless amount of storys to be yet told or formed.
							 Create your own journeys, storys, characters, factions, clans, or anything you can possibly amagine.
							 be one of the first people to join our ever growing community. And remember, dont let the laws of your reality
							 controll your imagination. Yet, there will still be rules, although not many complicated rules, these rules will 
							 still have to be followed: 
							 </p>
							 <p>
							Rule 1; There is a planet limit of 100 to be created, as or right now. 
							 </p>
							 <p>
							 Rule 2; Characters and groups can not surpass a certain power limit "which has not been clearly stated yet", so as of right now, go crazy.
							 </p>
							 <p>
							 Rule 3; Although groups created by different people are possably wanting to start wars, we are working on something that will resolve this 
                             and hopfully please people on what group would with these wars. "which will be explained in the next paragraph". But for now, 
                             try to find a way to solve this on your own. Mabey through fighting eachother in a different game to claim  victory or mabey resolve this issue through
                             comunication.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                             Rule 4; Either create a descriptive view of your caracter(s) including what group you are appart of, what planet you would like to be on, what county you 
                             would like to be in, and what bloodline you came from, as well as what the background to how you got to where you are now, is.	Or, which is encouraged to do,
                             is to create a two dementional illustration on what your character looks like, submit it to the website and create a discrption following the
                             guide lines in the first option "why this option is encouraged will be explained in the paragraph below."							 
							 </p>
							 <p>
							 Rule 5; Remember to have fun. This is what our universe was created for.
							 </p>
							 <h2>
							 Where This Is Hopefully Heading
							 </h2>
							 <p>
							 This website is a place to escape from your reality, whatever situation you may be in, and create a world of your own, where you could have fun with freinds,
							 or concor an entire world by your self, you could join a group, be or create a pirate, futuristic wizard, or a never before seen character that you have been 
							 wanting to create since you were a little kid. This is your place where you can do that.
							 </p>
							 <p>
							 Hopefully, this website can be shared, and turn into somthing much bigger than anyone ould have ever amagined, so everyone could find there happy place.
							 I am not sure how big this project will grow to become, but hopfull this project could some day have our own virtual game where you could settle battles with, having
							 your characters that you designed in game where you could controll them and defeat enemys and concor your country, world or one day... the entire galaxy.
							 </p>
							 <p>
							 One day we will need your help keeping the galixy alive, creating your game, and building our community.
							 </p>
